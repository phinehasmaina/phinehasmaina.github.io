                <p>Soccer is my favorite sport! Whenever I am free I usually
                    play soccer with friends. I competed in this year's college intramural
                    soccer and was able to qualify for the playoffs with my team.
                    My favorite soccer club in Manchester United situated in England.

                <p>I got exposed to programming when in 2020 through some python classes I took 
                    during my gap year before college. These classes played a huge factor in me choosing my major
                    since I originally did not really know what I wanted to do. Learning python made me love programming
                    and I have not looked back since.

                <p>I got introduced to games when I was three years old. I used to play GTA for fun with my uncles
                    back in Kenya. At around when I was 10 years old, I began playing FPS games like Return To Castle Wolfenstein
                    which is a mission based game. When I was 12 I started playing FIFA and became very good at it.
                    I am currently the school FIFA intramural champion. I plan on making my own games in the future!

                <p>This was my second project for the second semester of my freshman year!
                    For this project my team and I designed a robot using the lego Mindstorms
                    kit and arduino boards. The main objective of our robot was to deliver Color
                    coded packages to the corresponding color coded house. We got fourth place in
                    popularity vote for the final RGTAS competition where we presented our robot!

                <p> This was my very first successful python project! In this python project, my team
                    and I used several python algorithms to try make a machine learning model that could
                    predict if one would survive the titanic accident. We used the catboost algorithm
                    to make our model and that had an accuracy of 80%. This model was posted on kaggle
                    where our model ranked top 10% of all models that have been submitted to the competition!

                <p>Ever since I was 5 years old, I have been involved in performing music church youth events.
                    As a man of many talents,I have been blessed to learn 5 musical instruments so far. These 
                    include: Saxophone, piano, acoustic guitar, and the drums. I hope to learn two more; i.e.
                    the cello and the violin. In the future I would like to help produce music using the skills
                    that I have acquired.The picture above was me performing during a Christmas Carol service!
