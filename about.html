                <p>My name is Phinehas Maina and I was born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya.
                    I currently live in Moreno Valley,CA, and attend school at California
                    Baptist University. Here are some things I love to do in my free time!

                <p>Soccer is my favorite sport! Whenever I am free I usually
                    play soccer with friends. I competed in this year's college intramural
                    soccer and was able to qualify for the playoffs with my team.
                    My favorite soccer club in Manchester United situated in England.

                <p>I got exposed to programming when in 2020 through some python classes I took 
                    during my gap year before college. These classes played a huge factor in me choosing my major
                    since I originally did not really know what I wanted to do. Learning python made me love programming
                    and I have not looked back since.

                <p>I got introduced to games when I was three years old. I used to play GTA for fun with my uncles
                    back in Kenya. At around when I was 10 years old, I began playing FPS games like Return To Castle Wolfenstein
                    which is a mission based game. When I was 12 I started playing FIFA and became very good at it.
                    I am currently the school FIFA intramural champion. I am planning on making my own games in the future!
